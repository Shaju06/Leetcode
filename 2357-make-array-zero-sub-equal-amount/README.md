# 2357. Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts

## **Easy**

You are given a non-negative integer array nums. In one operation, you must:

* Choose a positive integer x such that x is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in nums.
* Subtract x from every positive element in nums.

Return the minimum number of operations to make every element in nums equal to 0.

## Example 1: 
 ```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed.
```

## Example 2: 
 ```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Each element in nums is already 0 so no operations are needed
```

## Constraint: 

```
 1 <= nums.length <= 100
```
 ```
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
```
